title: Advanced Usage of Application Commands

## Using with Slash Command builders

A Lunawork supports using third-party builders for Application Commands if they
return the Discord `JSON` object, like `@discord.js/builders'.

In the following example, we will use `@discordjs/builders` to create the simple
command with the output that can be used by the `@applicationCommand` decorator.

```typescript
import { LunaworkClient, Stage, applicationCommand } from '@siberianmh/lunawork'
import { CommandInteraction } from 'discord.js'
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from '@discord.js/builders'

// This also can be possible to do inside the class
const pingCommand = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName('ping')
  .setDescription('Check if this interaction is responsive.')
  .toJSON()

export class ExampleStage extends Stage {
  public constructor(client: LunaworkClient) {
    super(client)
  }

  // Will be executed by `/hello` command
  // And respond `Hello world` to the user
  @applicationCommand({ description: 'Give the greet' })
  public async greet(msg: CommandInteraction) {
    return msg.reply({ content: `Hello world.` })
  }

  // Can be executed using `/ping` command.
  // And respond the 'pong üèì' to the user
  @applicationCommand({ ...pingCommand })
  public async ping(msg: CommandInteraction) {
    return msg.reply({ content: 'pong üèì' })
  }
}
```
