title: applicationCommand decorator

## Usage

`@applicationCommand` decorator is a modern way to provide commands to users.
Using this decorator also automatically registers related application commands,
you can disable this state by `manageCommands` option in the `LunaworkClient`
constructor.

### Options

| name          | type                   | description                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`        | string                 | if provided this is being used as `name` for command instead of function name                    |
| `description` | string (required)      | the description for the command, required and will be shown when the user see a list of commands |
| `options`     | ApplicationCommandData | the list of options, see [discord.js] doc for this                                               |

#### Example

```typescript
import { LunaworkClient, Stage, applicationCommand } from '@siberianmh/lunawork'
import { CommandInteraction } from 'discord.js'

export class ExampleStage extends Stage {
  public constructor(client: LunaworkClient) {
    super(client)
  }

  // Will be executed by `/hello` command
  // And respond `Hello world` to the user
  @applicationCommand({ description: 'Give the greet' })
  public async greet(msg: CommandInteraction) {
    return msg.reply({ content: `Hello world.` })
  }
}
```
